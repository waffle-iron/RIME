## The Project

This is a little project I'm working on in my spare time, firstly to learn Ruby and Rails, and secondly because it's fun.  The idea is to make a chat application based on RINE from the visual novel Steins;Gate 0.

## Progress and Plans

See the [Issues](https://github.com/cow-co/RIME/issues) for a "TODO list" of things I want to implement.
